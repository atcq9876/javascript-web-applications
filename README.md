# javascript-web-applications

This repo contains my solutions for the Javascript Web Applications module of the Makers bootcamp (week seven). The objectives I achieved during this module include:
- Test-drive a simple Javascript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
- Use the DOM API to manipulate the web page structure and content.
- Use fetch to send HTTP requests to a remote server.

My completed end-of-week challenge for this module (a JavaScript app that shows the latest news headlines using the Guardian API) can be found [here](https://github.com/atcq9876/news-summary-challenge).
