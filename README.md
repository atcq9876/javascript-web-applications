# javascript-web-applications

This repo was made for the Javascript Web Applications module of the Makers bootcamp (week seven). The objectives of this module were to:

- Test-drive a simple Javascript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
- Use the DOM API to manipulate the web page structure and content.
- Use fetch to send HTTP requests to a remote server.

These objectives were achieved by working through a sequence of exercises and challenges over one week, a full list of which can be found in the original Makers module [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-web-applications).

My completed challenge for this week (a JavaScript app that shows the latest news headlines using the Guardian API) can be found [here](https://github.com/atcq9876/news-summary-challenge).
